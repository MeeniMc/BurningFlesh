# Burning Flesh

## Features

**Burning Flesh** is a Minecraft datapack that lets you use _rotten flesh_ and _arrows_ as a furnace fuel.

The noxious flesh can be burned in the furnace, and smoker, with the same cooking time as a _stick_.

## Rationale

The _rotten flesh_ in Minecraft is essentially a junk item with no real use. Even as a villager trading item, it is weak, as it requires a lot of clicks to get anywhere.

Many datapacks propose to smelt the _rotten flesh_ into _leather_. This is however in my opinion overpowered, and removes the incentive to have a cow or zogglin farming operation.

This datapack intends to provide a balanced, yet useful alternative.
